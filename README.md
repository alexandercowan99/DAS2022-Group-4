# DAS2022-Group-4

This is the Github respository for data analysis skills group 4.

We have been given an IMDB dataset of films which includes the films unique ID number, the release year of the film, the length of the film, the budget of the film (in $1000000s), the number of positive votes the film received by viewers, the genre of the film and the IMDB rating the film received. 

We have been tasked with finding which of these variables influences whether a film will receive a rating greater than 7 which we will do by experimenting with many logistic regression models.
