# DAS2022-Group-4

This is the Github respository for data analysis skills group 4.

We have been given an IMDB dataset of films which includes the films unique ID number, the release year of the film, the length of the film, the budget of the film (in $1000000s), the number of positive votes the film received by viewers, the genre of the film and the IMDB rating the film received. 

We have been tasked with finding which of these variables influences whether a film will receive a rating greater than 7 which we will do by experimenting with many logistic regression models.

The DAS2022-Group-4 repository is arranged as follows:

* dataset4.csv is the dataset that we have been given to analyse.
* The exploration_scripts folder contains the inital exploration of the dataset and testing of each model. 
* Group_4_analysis.Rmd contains all the finalised code that was used to find which variables influences whether a film will receive a rating greater than 7.
* Group_4_analysis.pdf is the pdf output of Group_4_analysis.Rmd file and Group_4_analysis.log is the associated log file of the Group_4_analysis.Rmd file.
